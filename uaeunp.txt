UAEUNP
======

uaeunp is simple command line file extractor supporting multiple (mostly Amiga specific) file formats.

Disk images:

- ADF and HDF. HDF support currently needs lots of memory.
- DMS (DiskMasher). Automatically brute-forces encrypted DMS files.
- DSQ (DiskSqueeze)
- FDI (Formatted Disk Image)
- IPF (SPS / CAPS disk images)
- WRP (Warp, note that there are multiple different "warp" formats. Only one is supported.)

Disk image is internally converted to standard ADF before extraction. Following filesystems
supported: OFS, FFS, SFS and SFS2. Non-AmigaDOS formatted images are not supported. Block size
is automatically detected.

Archives:

- 7Zip
- LHA/LZH
- LZX
- RAR (unrar.dll or archiveaccess.dll required)
- ZIP

Miscellaneous formats:

- Amiga RDB (Rigid Disk Block) partition table
- GZIP compression

USAGE
-----

<source> = path to directory. Path is not restricted to real physical path, virtual path inside archives and disk images are fully supported. (for example: "package.zip\dms\wb310.dms\wb310.adf\wb310.adf.dir\s" is 100% valid and working path and lists contents of directory 's')

package.zip is real file. dms is normal directory inside the archive. wb310.dms is file inside the archive. wb310.adf is unpacked virtual image of wb310.dms, wb310.adf.dir is virtual directory of wb310.adf, s is directory inside adf file. Number of recursive virtual directories is unlimited. 

Basic list files and directories:

"uaeunp <source>"

List all files and directories recursively:

"uaeunp <source> **"

Extract single file:

"uaeunp -x <source> <name of file to extract> [<destination file name>]"

Extract all recursively:

"uaeunp -x <source> **"

Extract all recursively to current directory (does not create subdirectories):

"uaeunp -e <source> <match string>" *=all, *.adf only adfs etc..

UAEUNP?
-------

Because it is basically command line "frontend" for WinUAE's transparent "archives as harddrive" framework.

EXAMPLES
--------

List wb310.adf root directory: "uaeunp wb310.adf"

Extract all files recursively in wb310.adf: "uaeunp wb310.adf **" (single * = extract only current directory)
       
Output s/shell-startup as text: "uaeunp wb310.adf\s shell-startup -o"

Decompress DMS to adf: "uaeunp wb310.dms wb310.adf"

List contents of DMS: "uaeunp wb310.dms\wb310.adf.dir"

List contents of adf inside lha archive: "uaeunp archive.lha\wb310.adf\wb310.adf.dir"
